                    <p>I need atleast 4 alarms back to back to ensure I am getting up on time for my official alarm. They all have titles from things that happened ages ago but I never change them because the idea of erasing them makes me a little sad.</p>

                    <p>Finch is a self care app where you take care of a little bird, by making a list of things you are going to do to take care of yourself. As you complete your list throughout the day your bird gains XP and can level/grow up. Theres meditations on there, journaling, and you can connect with your friends and support each other.</p>

                    <p>I love my car so much. I spend so much time just sitting around listening to music. I would also be nothing without carplay. I can listen to my spotify playlists, ask chatgpt my burning questions (resposibily) and have my reverse camera. I have no idea how people drove before the invention of a backup cam.</p>

                    <p>I am always listening to music, to the point where it would have been overkill to add a spotify screenshot, maybe also embarrassing? Me and my friends use airbuds to see what each other are listening to and send fun little reacts or messages. Its almost a part of my daily routine to go on there and judge/steal/react my friends musics. I didnt want to add anyone elses page so heres what I was just listening to.</p>

                    <p>I LOVE pinterest. Always have. It is possibly my favorite social media platform. I get so much inspiration on there. I also love to post my own photos into a board bevuase it feels like my secret hideway on the internet.</p>

There is a section for game play-by-plays with a brief description of what is currently being played. A section to see other live games.">
                    <p>The giants are playing an away game this week, and MLB does blackouts for local team viewing. So I have to rely on apples playbacks to keep me updated. Diamondback games are so important to me because we always get an easy win and I get to bully my friends over it. (my best friend is a dbacks fan)</p>

                    <p>This season me and all my friends, I met while studying abroad, decided to do a fantasy football league. We would always go out and beg the pub owner at The George in london to let us watch American Football. We all live in different states now but this keeps us connected! I am not doing too hot as you can tell.</p>
